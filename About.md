This is student project associated with my hobby(CS:GO skins and its market). Right now it`s in early development stage, but it must be a kind of search engine/items 
database(ain`t sure about balance yet). It`s written on Python Flask framework + MongoDB. Should be deployed on Azure, but some problems was met, so right now it is 
deployed on heroku.
