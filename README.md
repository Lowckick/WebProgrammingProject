ROADMAP:
1. Finish Azure deploying with CI/CD    ///Still need to finish deploying and fixing deploy bug(check debuging block)
2. SteamAPI connecting    ///Need to learn more about SteamAPI and viewall request to get all needed info
3. Database establishing    ///After gettting along with API, i need to create a functionality to save&update mongodb database
4. Creating search engine    /// Must create a base search engine for a future establishing
5. Configurating engine for our purposes    ///Created for CS skins, must work with them, some search algorithm and sites rating will be needed
6. Creating a better and unique design ///After finishing backend it will important to create design for a site


README:
Right now there is a bug or code problem with deploying, but you can still launch it on your local host. Just launch code in your chosen environment and it will get it done and will give you localhost link(default localhost:5000)


DEBUGING+Minidevblog:
Need to deploy it at least somewhere. There is a problem with that, it`s just didn`t launching. Will optimize code and files, check it again. If still won`t be working, should thing about something else. Maybe swithcing to Jango, not sure yet.
Right now project is deployed to Heroku, just to be sure it`s working(spoiler:it is). 
Learned a bit about Steam Api, used it to collect info about 100 market items, insert it into mongodb and configure to be shown on web-site.
Configure Gunicorn for Heroku deployment.

Technology used for now:
1. Python
2. MongoDB
3. Visual Code
4. Azure
5. pymongo
6. Heroku
7. Gunicorn
8. Steam API
