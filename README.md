README:
Right now there is a bug or code problem with deploying, but you can still launch it on your local host. Just launch code in your chosen environment and it will get it done and will give you localhost link(default localhost:5000)


DEBUGING:
Need to deploy it at least somewhere. There is a problem with that, it`s just didn`t launching. Will optimize code and files, check it again. If still won`t be working, should thing about something else. Maybe swithcing to Jango, not sure yet.

Technology used for now:
1. Python
2. MongoDB
3. Visual Code
4. Azure
5. pymongo
